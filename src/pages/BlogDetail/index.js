                However, as the space keeps expanding and people proceed to mint
                thousands of NFTs every day, an important question arises - how
                do we make sure that all that creative work remains accessible
                over time?
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted">
                Earlier this year, as NFTs began hitting the mainstream, the
                industry faced a major technical problem. As highlighted by some
                analysts, most of the JPEGs (or other file formats) that serve
                as the media basis for their respective NFTs weren't stored on
                the chain itself. Instead, NFTs often simply redirected to a URL
                where the corresponding media was hosted - in most cases, that
                was a separate domain that belonged to either the creator or the
                platform where that NFT was minted.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted">
                But what happens when those domains go down? With that
                discovery, it became apparent that some NFTs have a single point
                of failure, which, in turn, could significantly impact their
                longevity and value.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted mb-0">
                In light of that, numerous projects and organisations have begun
                working on a potential fix. In a recent Clubhouse session, we
                brought those pioneering protocols and projects - Protocol Labs
                (an open-source lab that is working on Filecoin, IPFS and
                libp2p), Async.art, Fleek and Arweave - together to have a
                constructive discussion about the future of NFT metadata. Here's
                a concise recap of the main ideas that were discussed there.
              </p>

                  digital tokens "
                </h4>
              </div>

              <div className="mt-4">
                <img
                  src={bg10}
                  className="img-fluid rounded-md shadow"
                  alt=""
                />
              </div>

              <h5 className="mt-4 mb-0">What's an NFT?</h5>
              <p className="text-muted mt-4">
                This is the part that takes a bit of open-mindedness. An NFT is
                a unique digital token, with most using the ethereum blockchain
                to digitally record transactions. It's not a cryptocurrency like
                bitcoin or ether, because those are fungible -- exchangeable for
                another bitcoin or cash. NFTs are recorded in a digital ledger
                in the same way as cryptocurrency, so there's a listing of who
                owns each one.
              </p>

              <p className="text-muted mb-0">
                What makes an NFT unique is the digital asset tied to the token.
                This can be an image, video, tweet or piece of music that's
                uploaded to a marketplace, which creates the NFT to be sold.
