In the meeting we decided for right now we need to have something up for a demo. I am going to handpick a few collections to start with. On that side where it says mint or list it will feed most of the data from an internal database. Kevan asked me what I thought were the most basics options needed and in what orders for anyone who is a home owner that would login and buy membership token
Here are the basics of how anyone would search/select from a drop down menu:

V1. Property Address 1 (1015 SW 43rd Avenue)

Property Address 2 (normally a unit or suite # like 301 or A if multi unit. In this case blank/NA) 

Property City (Miami) 
Property State (FL)
Property Zip Code (33134)
Property Country (USA)

V2. Property House # (1015)
Property Pre Direction (SW)
Property Street name (43)
Property Street Type (Ave)
Unit # (normally a unit or suite # like 301 or A if multi unit. In this case blank/NA) 
Property City (Miami) 
Property State (FL)
Property Zip Code (33134)
Property Country (USA)

V2 is faster for condos or multi units 

The rest should auto fill from JSON database with basics:

Tier B: 

# Bedrooms 
# Bathrooms 
Lot size (sq ft)
Pool? (Yes or no)
Garage (Yes or no)
HOA (yes or no) 

If there is any discrepancy in tier B.  the user
should not be able to mint or list for sale without contacting for further help.
